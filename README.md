! NOTICE !

This project is a part of an academic study (Bachelor's thesis).
The work ended with submitting its paper, so the content stays compatible.
The issues are unchanged and there are no new commits.
If the work will be continued, link to a new repository would be added to the README.
Related documents and designs can be find within the repository's issues.
It should be noted that designs from the "List of features" issue were not fully implemented due to lack of time.
The final version of the app doesn't feature the dungeon's spell mechanic and updates the dungeon's state with every wish.
